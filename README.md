# MECH3895 Project - Robotic Manipulation Planning

This repository contains the source code for the MECH3895 project "Robotic Manipulation Planning".


Note: if Gazebo models need to be installed, Gazebo node may not launch correctly. Gazebo will take some time to load as it is downloading required models, once loaded the arm will probably just fall due to controller timeout. Resolved by relaunching after Gazebo finishes downloading models and loads up.
